Virtual File System is a tree made of VfsEntry nodes, which represent files/directories.
VfsManager holds the root node "/" and manages the tree by means of get/create/copy/move/delete actions.
To mount an actual physical filesystem under the root, you need to add VfsMountPoint, which exposes get/create/move/delete actions of specific filesystem to the VfsManager.
